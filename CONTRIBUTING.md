## Contribution
Contributing is fine, we do not mind as long as it is appropiate, and has attribution.

## Attribution
1. All code must have attribution somewhere in the file. If you are editing/contributing to something, please add a comment that has the following text: "Edited &/or contributed by: (Your Name, or Github Username)"

1. If you are forking this project, or you are taking a file that you wish to be distributed as a guise that you "own" it, please add contribution to **us** even if you don't decide to publish it to Github or anywhere else.

## Overall
If you are/will be contributing, please add attribution to both **us** & **yourself** so crooked people don't have a chance to steal it for themselves.
